# starterjs.dev
This repo contains the source code and documentation powering [starterjs.dev](https://starterjs.dev/).

## Starter.js
[Starter.js](https://starterjs.dev/) is an opinionated lightweight starter kit for building Modern Web Apps using React. It comes with all the modern tooling, which one can directly configure. Starter.js is _framework-agnostic_, i.e. it does not depend on any particular React framework. If you would like to work within a framework, you can check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
